		<h2>Get ahead with Ubuntu and Canonical</h2>
		<p>As Ubuntu use grows around the world, demand for compatible devices is increasing fast. From thin clients, desktops and laptops to enterprise servers, manufacturers are looking to capitalise.</p>
		<p>To get to market quicker and reduce costs, OEMs and their partners need components that are compatible with the latest Ubuntu releases. For IHVs and ISVs, the big question is how to develop, test and certify such products.</p>
		<p>The answer is to work with Canonical, the company sponsoring the Ubuntu project. OEMs, IHVs, ISVs and peripheral manufacturers can subscribe to the Canonical Technical Partner Programme, which provides all the information, tools and training a manufacturer needs to keep its products ahead of the Ubuntu development curve.</p>
		<p>In addition to the Technical Partner Programme, we work together with the worldâ€™s leading silicon vendors and OEMs to install Ubuntu on their hardware and ensure it works seamlessly. These partnerships result in the worldwide availability of stable, secure and performance-optimised Ubuntu devices.</p>
