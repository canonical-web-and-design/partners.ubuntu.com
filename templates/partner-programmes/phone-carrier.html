		<h2>Ubuntu Carrier Advisory Group</h2>
		<p>The Ubuntu Carrier Advisory Group (CAG) lets mobile operators shape Ubuntu&rsquo;s mobile strategy. Members receive advance confidential briefings and provide us with industry insight to ensure that Ubuntu meets their needs.</p>
		<p>Members of the CAG have the opportunity to be a launch partner and gain the right to ship Ubuntu in markets they serve. They also benefit from regular CAG meetings, wide industry participation and launch priority.</p>
		<p>The Carrier Advisory Group is chaired independently of Canonical by David Wood, who has 25 years&rsquo; experience in the mobile industry, including leadership roles at Psion, Symbian and Accenture. He has wide experience with collaborative advisory groups, and twice served on the board of directors of the OMA (Open Mobile Alliance).</p>
