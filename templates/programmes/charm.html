        <h1>Charm Partner Programme</h1>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re an Independent Software Vendor (ISV)  you know how
        difficult it can be for your customers to realise the full value of your
        software. Releasing your solutions with Juju, the award-winning
        application modelling tool from Canonical, can help your customers use
        your product at every stage, from proof of concept and development,
        through to full scale deployment.</p>

        <h2>The power of charms</h2>
        <p>Juju lets you model, integrate and scale applications quickly and easily.
        By creating a Juju charm for your product, you make it easy for administrators
        and devops teams to integrate it with hundreds of other solutions.</p>
        <p>Charms are sets of scripts that simplify the deployment and management
        tasks of specific services. They can be written in any language and leverage
        configuration management tools. Once a Charm has been created by your developers,
        anyone can use it to unleash the full power of your software.</p>
        <p>The Juju Charm Store has over 300 applications ready to use today. They
        can even be combined in Bundles. If your application is commonly deployed
        with other services (as most are) a customer can use a Charm Bundle to deploy
        all the services together, wherever they need to run.</p>

        <h2>Deploy, connect and scale</h2>
        <p>Juju automates and speeds up the deployment, scaling and managing of distributed applications. By creating a Juju charm for your product, you make it easy for administrators and devops teams to integrate it with hundreds of other solutions.</p>
        <p>It gets better. Juju charms can be combined in bundles: if your software is usually deployed with other services,  a customer can use a charm bundle to deploy all the services together. All the detailed configuration settings and relationships between services are handled by Juju.</p>
