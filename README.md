Local development
---

The simplest way to run the site for local development is to use
[devrun](https://github.com/ubuntudesign/docker-devrun) as follows:

### Install Docker

First ensure you [have Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/products/docker).

On Ubuntu, you may find you need to [fix the DNS](https://robinwinslow.uk/files/2016/06/23/fix-docker-networking-dns/).

### Run local server

Run the site on <http://localhost:8003> as follows:

``` bash
./run  # Run the development server on port 8003
```
